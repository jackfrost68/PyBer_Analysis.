# Overview of the analysis
Pyber, a ride-sharing company, would like to improve access access and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. In this analysis, I conduct an exploratory analysis on data from csv files. Further, using various charts, I look into relationships between the type of city and number of driver and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, rider and drivers per type of city. 

# Results
Below is a breakdown of the analysis;

# Summary
To address the disparities among city types, I'd recommend the following to the CEO;

1. Introduce discounts for riders with with longer ride history.
2. Introduce a marketing strategy that focuses on the rural markets.  
3. Introduce a monthly membership subscription for riders in urban cities.
